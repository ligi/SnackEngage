### What

Engage users with a [Snackbar][material-snackbars] from the design lib to e.g. rate or translate the app.

### How

Get the dependency via JitPack: [![](https://jitpack.io/v/ligi/snackengage.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#ligi/snackengage)

or from JCenter ( might be behind JitPack ) like this:
```groovy
implementation "org.ligi:snackengage:$version"
```

Just add this where you want ( e.g. in the `onCreate` method of your entry activity )

```java
SnackEngage.from(this).withSnack(new DefaultRateSnack()).build().engageWhenAppropriate();
```

This would than show this snack after some opportunities and never again when once clicked on `Rate` ( which takes you to Play store or F-Droid - anything that accepts the generated `market://` link )

#### Other snacks that are possible:

or create your own snack - e.g. to make a survey.

combine them as you wish and add your own conditions:

```java
SnackEngage.from(view)
           .withSnack(new DefaultRateSnack())
           .withSnack(new GooglePlayOpenBetaTestSnack()
                              .withConditions(new NeverAgainWhenClickedOnce(),
                                              new AfterNumberOfOpportunities(42)))
           .withSnack(new TranslateSnack("https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/snackengage")
                              .withConditions(new IsOneOfTheseLocales(Locale.CANADA),
                              new NeverAgainWhenClickedOnce(),
                              new AfterNumberOfOpportunities(10)))

           .build()
           .engageWhenAppropriate();
```

The rate snack exists in different versions: snackengage-playrate and snackengage-amazonrate. You can use them in different flavors of your app.

### Why

This lib came to exist because I wanted something like [discreet-app-rate](https://github.com/PomepuyN/discreet-app-rate) - but using a Snackbar from the new material design support lib which was emerging at Google I/O 2015.
After thinking about it I wanted to make it more broad - not only for rating - also engaging users by pointing them to beta-testing and translation.

### Details

The DefaultRateSnack just configures a RateSnack with default conditions:

```java
public class DefaultRateSnack extends RateSnack {

    public DefaultRateSnack() {
        withConditions(new NeverAgainWhenClickedOnce(), new AfterNumberOfOpportunities(5));
    }

}
```

you can easily roll your own analog to this default one:

```java
public class AfterNumberOfOpportunities implements SnackCondition {

    private final int number;

    public  AfterNumberOfOpportunities(final int number) {
        this.number = number;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isAppropriate(final SnackContext context, final Snack snack) {
        return context.getStats().getOpportunitiesSinceLastSnack() > number;
    }
}
```

you can also have a custom snack with an image added:

![rate screenshot](doc/screenshots/with_icon_small.png)

```java
.withSnack(new OpenURLSnack("market://details?id=org.ligi.survivalmanual", "survival") {

  @NonNull
  @Override
  protected Snackbar createSnackBar(final SnackContext snackContext) {
    Snackbar snackbar = super.createSnackBar(snackContext);
    final TextView textView = (TextView) snackbar.getView().findViewById(android.support.design.R.id.snackbar_text);
    textView.setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBounds(R.mipmap.survival, 0, 0, 0);
    textView.setCompoundDrawablePadding(getResources().getDimensionPixelOffset(R.dimen.rhythm));
    return snackbar;
  }
}.overrideTitleText("Other App by ligi:\nFree Offline Survival Guide")
 .overrideActionText("Get It!")
```

### Hints

If you use a FloatingActionButton inside a CoordinatorLayout from the design-lib and they are not coordinated - pass a view into snackengage from which the Snackbar can find the CoordinatorLayout - e.g. the fab:

```java
SnackEngage.from(fab)..;
```

So the movements between Snackbar and FAB are coordinated
